## Data Management and Persistence
This application operates using client-side storage to maximize privacy and speed.

* **Local Storage:** All application data (jobs, goals, tasks, and links) is stored in your browser's Local Storage.
* **Device Specific:** Data is not synchronized across devices. You must use the same device and browser to access your saved information.
